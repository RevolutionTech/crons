This is a place where I keep various Lambda scripts, which I configure as scheduled events. Feel free to use/modify them as desired.

To update the Lambda, [create a Python deployment package](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python-how-to-create-deployment-package.html) containing the Python script, as well as any dependencies necessary. Then, upload this .zip file to Lambda.
